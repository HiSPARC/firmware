Message Structures HiSPARC
==========================

The HiSPARC electronics communicate to the PC using structured messages. These
message structures are described on this page.


Dataflow example
----------------

In normal operation the electronics receive synchronization pulses from the
GPS called the Pulse Per Second (PPS). The time between PPS is counted by the
internal 200 MHz clock, the value is reset at each PPS and the final value is
called the Count Ticks between PPS (CTP). When the PPS occurs the HiSPARC
electronics sends a one second message to the PC containing the CTP value.
When a trigger occurs the clock counter is also stored, this value is called
the Count Ticks to Data (CTD). This is sent to the PC in a measured data
message. An example of the order of these messages and their relation to the
GPS clock and internal clock is shown in the following figure.

Successive data to PC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

================ =========================== =========== =====================

.. note::
   The time stamps in the messages are offset by one second. This is because
   the Primary Timing Packet containing the GPS time stamp information is sent
   by the GPS module to the electronics up to 20 ms after the PPS. This is
   taken into account when calculating the exact event time, see
   :eq:`timestamp`.


How to calculate the right event time
-------------------------------------

.. image:: images/event_time.png
   :width: 550px

When a measured data message is received by the PC it needs to wait two more
seconds before it can accurately calculate the GPS timestamp of the event.
This is because two one second messages of the following PPS's are required.
These contain the CTP, :math:`\Delta t_{\mathrm{Q1}}`, and :math:`\Delta
t_{\mathrm{Q2}}`. The one second message before the measured data message
(i.e. with the same time stamp) contains the Sn and :math:`\Delta
t_{\mathrm{Sync}}`.

.. math::
   \mathrm{Time[ns]} =
      (\mathrm{Sn} + 1) \cdot 10^9 + 
      \Delta t_{\mathrm{Sync}} + \Delta t_{\mathrm{Q1}} +
      \left(\frac{\mathrm{CTD}}{\mathrm{CTP}}\right) \cdot
      \left(10^9 - \Delta t_{\mathrm{Q1}} + \Delta t_{\mathrm{Q2}}\right)
   :label: timestamp

The electronics generates event-message-data and second-message-data. The
event-message-data is labeled on second basis by the GPS time stamp. To get
the event time in nanosecond accuracy, the following has to be done. Take for
example an event measured in time Sn (second n). The event-data contains a CTD
value. This is the counter value of the system 200 MHz counter latched at the
incomming event. The CTD value represents the number of 5 ns steps from a PPS
(Pulse Per Second) signal till the incomming event. A PPS signal comes every
second from the GPS reciever. First the ratio between CTD and CTP has to be
calculated. CTP is the end value of the 200 MHz counter at the moment of a PPS
signal. The CTP value belonging to the CTD value of Sn comes in the 
second-message-data of Sn+1. This ratio has to be multiplied with a "real"
second expressed in nanoseconds. The time between two PPS signals should be
exactly one second. Unfortunately the PPS signals have a time error with
respect to a "world second". This error is called the quantization error and
can be read from the second-message-data. The quantization errors for
event-message-data Sn are in second-message-data Sn+1 (Quantization error 1)
en second-message-data Sn+2 (Quantization error 2). Now the ratio CTD/CTP can
be expressed in nanoseconds and has to be add with a time offset. The time
offset is the sum of the first quantization error and a synchronization error.
By synchronizing the asynchrone PPS signal with the 200 MHz counter a
synchronization error is made. This could be an error of maximal 5 ns. This is
reduced to 2.5 ns by clocking the least significant bit of the counter on the
negative edge of the 200 MHz system clock also. The highest bit (bit31) of CTP
in the second-message-data indicates if the time offset has to be adjust with
2.5 ns. The synchronization error for event-message-data Sn is in 
second-message-data Sn.


HiSPARC messages

General message structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

====== ========== ============ ======= ===
Header Identifier Message info Data    End
====== ========== ============ ======= ===
99     1 byte     N bytes      N bytes 66
====== ========== ============ ======= ===

A message always starts with a header byte (99h) followed by an identifier
byte, message info, data and an end byte (66h). The identifier byte gives the
type of the message. Types are e.g. GPS time, measurement data, control
setting etc. The message info bytes give some information about the data.
Message info can be trigger information or time settings. In case of a control
setting this information is omitted (N = 0). The number of data bytes depends
on the type. In case of a control setting it will be a few bytes and in case
of measured event data it can be a few thousand bytes.


One second message
------------------

Every second on a pulse per second signal (1PPS) from the GPS receiver, the
HiSPARC electronics sends a message to the computer. The time information is
used for calibration. This message contains also the number of times that an
analog input signal went over a threshold level during 1 second. After these
bytes, 61 bytes of satellite signal information are sent.

CTP
^^^

CTP is a counter value. CTP represents the number of clock periods of the 200
MHz clock between two PPS signals. This value will be renewed every second. It
will be set to one on a PPS signal and counts up in 5 ns steps till the next
PPS signal. On a PPS signal this value is stored and set to one again.

.. warning::
   The highest bit (bit 31) of CTP in the second-message-data indicates if the
   time offset has to be adjust with 2.5 ns. This is the :math:`\Delta
   t_{\mathrm{Sync}}` in :eq:`timestamp`. This bit should be removed before the
   CTP value is used in :eq:`timestamp`!

Trigger condition
-----------------

The trigger condition byte is set by LabView. The content of this byte selects
a pattern that allows a coincidence of the input event signals which go over
threshold. Every input signal can be discriminated with two threshold levels;
a low- and a high level. A HiSPARC electronic unit has two inputs. Two units
can be combined as a master and a slave. Therefore combinations can be made of
eight input signals over threshold voltages (threshold signals). There are
four high signals and four low signals. If a slave is not present, the high
and low signals from the slave are zero. A coincidence can also be forced with
an external trigger signal. The trigger condition of threshold signals is
selected with bit 0 to 5 of the trigger matrix byte. The external trigger is
selected with bit 6. The most significant bit selects the calibration mode.
When this bit is active, the other 7 bits are omitted. If a signal goes above
the high threshold, then of course it also goes above the low threshold.
Therefore if the condition is e.g. "at least two low signals", then this means
that the condition is also met when there is one signal low and one high. Or
if there are two high signals. Or when there is one high signal and two low
ones, etc.

Trigger pattern
---------------

The trigger pattern contains two bytes. The lower byte gives the status of the
threshold signals at the coincidence. Later on, in the analysis, one can trace
back which signals(s) made the coincidence happen, taking the trigger
condition in account. The higher byte contains information about the HiSPARC
electronic set and the external trigger. Each channel has two hardware
comparators on the analog input. The input signal is compared with two
threshold levels: -5 V and -10 V. These levels are beyond the ADC
digitalization range. The compared signals are also latched at a coincidence.

==================== =================================

Higher byte, bit 7   Calibration mode
==================== =================================


Time Windows
------------

There are three time windows which are placed next to each other. Together
they form the total time in which the data of an event is stored and readout.

.. image:: images/windows.jpg
   :width: 627px


The Pre time window can be set from 0 µs to 2 µs.

The Coincidence time window can be set from 0 µs to 5 µs.

The Post time window can be set from 0 µs to 8 µs.

The coincidence window time may not be larger than the post window time. The
total time may not be larger than 10 us.

The times are set in 5 ns steps. In other words the contents of the pre time
window byte must be between 0 and 400. The value of the coincidence window
byte must be between 0 and 1000. The value of the post time window byte must
be between 0 and 1600.


Data Time
---------

On a coincidence the momentarily time is latched. The time consists of the GPS
time and the CTP (Count Ticks between PPS) time.


Data
----

The sum of the three window bytes cannot exceed 2000 steps of 5 ns. The time
resolution of one channel is 2.5 ns. The analog input is sampled with a 12 bit
amplitude resolution and the output words to the computer are 8 bit. This
means that there are 1.5 times more output words than sampled values per
channel. Therefore the number of data output bytes is six times (5 ns / 2.5 ns
x 2 channels x 1.5) the sum of the three window bytes.


Comparator data message
-----------------------

As said before: Each channel has two hardware comparators on the analog input.
The input signal is compared with two threshold levels (defaults are -5 V and
-10 V). If the input signal exceeds one of the levels, the GPS time is latched
and the time the signal stays larger than the level is counted in 5 ns steps.
If one or more comparators detect a input signal larger then their level, a
message is generated.

Status byte
-----------

At the moment only bit 0, 1 and 7 are implemented. Bits 6 down to 2 are zero.
Bit 0 is the master bit and will be high if the electronics have a GPS on
board. Bit 1 is the slave-present bit and will be high if a slave unit is
detected.


Version number
--------------

The version number has a length of three bytes and consists of two parts: a
software- and a hardware part. The ten lower bits (9 down to 0) represent a
hardware serial number. Each unit has his own serial number / address and is
set by jumpers on the board. The eight higher bits (23 down to 16) represent a
software version of the code of the field programmable gate array (FPGA). Bits
15 down to 10 are logical zero.


How to startup
--------------

Connect the HiSPARC Electronics via USB with the PC and switch the power of
the electronics on. Run the LabView program and a master module should be
recognized as "HiSPARC II Master"and a slave module as "HiSPARC II Slave" (or
"III" instead of "II"). After switching the electronics on or after a soft
reset, the electronics is in listing mode. This means that there will be no
data sent from the electronics to the PC. To put the electronics in writing
mode also, the least significant bit of Spare bytes has to be set. Thus the
first command for LabView to send must be 99 35 00 00 00 01 66. After this,
the statusword can be asked by applying a get control parameter list command
(99 55 66). The statusword can be found in the 32th byte returned data. There
can be checked if the module is a master (least significant bit - b0 = '1') or
a slave (b0 = '0'). When a slave module is attached to a master, then b1 = '1'
in the statusword of the master. After switching the electronics on or after a
soft reset, the module does not send one second messages. To put this on, bit
1 of Spare bytes has to be set also by sending 99 35 00 00 00 03 66. Now, the
electronics is fully up and running.


Features
--------

- From startup it is not possible to program the GPS reciever. This can be
  enabled by setting bit 2 of Spare bytes to '1'. If this bit is set, it is
  possible to program the GPS reciever with the software from Trimble.
- Only a master and slave combination can work like a 4 channel oscilloscoop.
  The master generates a common trigger for the two modules from the data of
  the four inputs. To let a master/master or slave/slave combination work, a
  master has to be forced to work as slave or a slave as master. This can be
  done when bit 3 of Spare bytes is set to '1'. This bit alternates the
  master/slave state.
